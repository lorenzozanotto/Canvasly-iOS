# Canvasly-iOS ✏️
Minimal markdown editor for iOS. Takes advantage of **MarkdownTextView** to provide markdown support.

Nothing too special with this project, I created Canvasly to give a walkthrough of a simple iOS app in
a Swift workshop, feel free to use this code at your convenience. Make sure to include the external libraries defined in the `Cartfile`

### Demo
